As we celebrate 22 months together, I wanted to take a moment to tell you how much you mean to me. Every day with you is a gift that I cherish more than words can express.

You've brought so much light, love, and laughter into my life. The way you smile, the sound of your laugh, the way you see the world - everything about you fills my heart with joy.

This journey we're on together is the most beautiful adventure, and I'm so grateful to have you by my side. Thank you for your love, your patience, and for being the amazing person that you are.

I love you more with each passing day, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.

Forever yours,
Satyam`;
